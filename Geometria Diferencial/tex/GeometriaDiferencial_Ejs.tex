%Let $M$ and $N$ be differentiable manifolds where $\{(U_α, f_α)\}$ is a differentiable structure for $M$ and $\{(V_β, g_β)\}$ is a differentiable structure for $N$.

%Consider the cartesian product $M \times N$ and the maps $\appl{h_{αβ}}{U_α\times V_β}%{M \times N}$ given by
%\[h_άβ}(x,y)=(f_α(x),g_β(y) \ \ x\in U_α, \ y\in V_β\]%

%Show that $\{(U_α\times V_β, h_{αβ})\}$ is a differetiable structure for $M \times N$ %which is then called the product manifold of $M$ and $N$. Describe the product %manifold $S^1 \times S^1$ of two circles, where $S^1$ has the usual differentiable %structure
